**OmniDork** is a simple yet powerful research dashboard. I designed it to help OSINT researchers and security enthusiasts move faster by taking the "mental math" out of search dorking. It wraps complex search syntax into a clean, "Liquid Obsidian" interface that’s a joy to work in.

## 🌟 Why OmniDork?

I built this because search dorking often feels like a game of memorizing confusing commands. OmniDork changes that by providing a visual home for your queries. 

- **Multi-Engine Power**: No more rewriting queries for different sites. It handles the syntax for **Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Startpage, and Brave** automatically.
- **Two Ways to Play**:
    - **Normal Mode**: For when you know what you're looking for but don't want to type `intitle:index.of (mp4)` for the hundredth time.
    - **Pro Mode**: A "cheat sheet" of 40+ verified security dorks to help you stay sharp during reconnaissance.
- **Privacy First**: There are no trackers, no external CDNs, and no "phoning home." It runs entirely on your machine.
- **Works Everywhere**: It’s a static app, so it’s as fast as your browser and works even if you’re offline.

### Just want to use it locally?
1.  **Download** the files.
2.  Double-click `index.html`.

## 📂 What's inside?
OmniDork is built with simple, modern web code. It uses a hybrid system that fetches data when it’s on a server but falls back to a built-in "Local Engine" when you're working offline.
